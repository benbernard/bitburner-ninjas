# bitburner-ninjas

Run `npm install` to get eslint installed

Run `npm start` to start server on port 3000


## Installing in Bitburner

Use `wget` against localhost:3000 and load into 'netrun.js'.  I recommend
setting up an alias so that you can reload it directly if you modify netrun.js
and need to reload from scratch.

  alias reload="wget http://localhost:3000 netrun.js"
